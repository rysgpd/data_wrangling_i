September 17 Lecture: This document will show how to import data.

```{r setup, echo= FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# can do library(janitor) and then just do clean_names, but it's only one function that we actually need so don't want to load the entire package.
library(readxl)
library(haven)
```
